## Predicting the Rating of a Company Using Employee Reviews
### Abstract
In this project paper we analyse dataset with user reviews and ratings 
of a few major tech companies. The dataset is using Glassdoor data and 
was available on Kaggle. The goal is to predict a rating (full 1-to-5 star 
or simplified positive/negative) based on user review and other information.
This goal is quite similar to the one of sentiment analysis. So we use traditional
LSTM model with (or without) pretrained embeddings. We use NB as a baseline model.
We get pretty high accuracy (around .8-.9) with some simplified assumptions.

## questions
- stop words - should we use them?
- how to prepare data for deep learning? do we need stemming and all of that?
